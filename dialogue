Press x to change
this column.A wall.
You cannot step
through these.
Obviously.An open door.
Feel free to
step through.

But remember:
they can also
step through.A closed door.
Maybe try opening
it first?

Ram your face into
it, or walk up and
press enter on it.The exit.
Walk on it when
you are ready
to leave.A sign.
It has a message.
Maybe read it.The most basic and
weakest enemy.

If it glows red, it
is winding up to
smack you.

Don't let it.Maybe get some
items, then you
can use this
panel.No magics?The most basic boss.

That doesn't mean
weakest.When it glows purple
it is winding up to
cast a spell.

Don't stand on it
or stand still.

Kill it to remove
the spells.Another boss.

It will make more.

No there isn't a
limit.

That isn't all it
does though,
be careful.A nasty one if you
aren't careful.

You can beat these
without getting hit

Just not without
spending energy.


Don't run too far,
they will catch upAn exceptionally
nasty boss.

Do NOT run away in
an open room.

ALWAYS be on the
move.

It also kind of
looks like a
crawfish...

Fun fact: I had to
modify map gen
because this was
nuking people the
moment they spawned
in.He is an archer
He fires arrows

What did you
expect?Archer but boss.

His regular arrows
hit like a truck.

But the magical
barrage doesn't hit
as hard.A target dummy.

Learn how to hit it.

When enemies take
damage, they go
[3mitalic[0m

This one won't fight
back, others will.Gives you health regen
for 10 turns at 2
health per turn.It tells you the
location of the
nearest boss or
exit.It doubles or halves
your money.

It isn't actually
that simple but that
is all you need to
know, for now.It teleports you where
you throw it.

If it hits something
along the way then you
will teleport there
instead.Teleport you to your
selector.

It does not care about
obstacles.

It will not work if
you try to teleport
onto an invalid space.It makes you TITLECARD
for 10 turns.

It makes you have
boosted damage for
40.

It even sobers you
up!A "spirit"

Probably not the kind
you were thinking of.

You get a bit stupid
when drunk.

But at least you hit
hard?Gives you far sight
for 20 turns.Immediately heals
you for 20 health

but then poisons
you for 10 turns
at 1 damage per.

Yes the poison
does stack.

And yes this is
a poison poisson.Immediately restore
10 energy.

You don't get any
of the extra.Allows you to see
all map geometry
even if you haven't
seen it yet.Gives enemies
disadvantage on
perception checks.Causes convertion
to happen on energy
at a time instead of
consuming all in one
go.Causes a signal when
your energy is full.Causes you to regain
health equal to the
amount of energy
given by a kill.Causes you to be able
to interact with map
objects (like doors)
from anywhere.Increses your max
energy by 50%Increases your max
health by 50%With one mage eye
you can see the
positions of
reachable enemies.

With two you can
see them fully.With one seer eye
you can see when an
enemy is aiming at
you.

With two you can see
where they are aiming.Doubles your moneyIncreases your max
health by 50% and
heals you to full.Fairly complicated.

It picks from a bunch
of positive things it
can do based on your
state.

First it will
increase your
perception.Increases your max
energy by 50%A savepint.

You can figure it
out, I believe in
you.A contact spell which
drains health and
gives it back to you.

Deals one to four hits
of damage, multiplied
by energy / 5

It heals you for 10x
the hits dealt.

So if it deals three
hits of damage, then
you will heal for 30
health.Swaps your position
with a random enemy
within a radius of
energy x 10

So by default it has
a radius of 30It's a fireball

More energy ->
More radius and
damage.

What did you expect?It gets information
about the thing under
the selector.

It will fail if you
give it any other
amount of energy.Charge towards a
position.

If you hit an enemy,
you will stop and deal
damage.Teleport you along a
path.

If an obstacle is hit
you will stop.Summons a "spirit"Heals you.

What is special about
this is that it gets
more efficient the
more energy you put in
